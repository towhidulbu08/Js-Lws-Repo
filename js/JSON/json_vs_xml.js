 # Both JSON and XML can be used to receive data from a web server.

##Similarities:

 
=>Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
=>Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
=>Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
=>Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest


## Differences:

=>JSON doesn't use end tag
=>JSON is shorter
=>JSON is quicker to read and write
=>JSON can use arrays


##Why JSON is Better Than XML:

=>JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.
